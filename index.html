    <h1>MapJams Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 24th, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>MapJams respects your privacy. This policy explains what information our application collects, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>Precise Location:</strong> MapJams accesses your precise geographic location to trigger music playback based on your position. Your location data is accessed in real-time but is never stored, transmitted, or shared with third parties.</p>

    <p><strong>User Files:</strong> MapJams may access music files or other files from your device, but only after you explicitly grant permission. Files you authorize remain on your device and are never shared or uploaded externally.</p>

    <p><strong>User-Defined Maps:</strong> Maps or regions that you create and define are stored locally on your device. MapJams does not transfer these maps or related information to any external servers or third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>MapJams prioritizes your privacy and data security. Since your data is not transmitted externally, all information remains secure and localized on your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. You are encouraged to periodically review this page for any updates.</p>
